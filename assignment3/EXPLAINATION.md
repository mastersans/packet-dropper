Problem Statement 3: Explain the Code Snippet.
-------------------------

```css
package main
import "fmt";

func main() {
    cnp := make(chan func(), 10)
    for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
        go func() {
            for f := range cnp {
                f()
            }
        }()
    }
    cnp <- func() {
        fmt.Println("HERE1")
    }
    fmt.Println("Hello")
}
```

Explaining the constructs:
-------------------------

**Buffered Channel (`make(chan func(), 10)`):** This line kicks off a channel called "cnp" that can stash away functions, and it's got space for up to 10 of 'em. Think of it like a bucket that can hold tasks for later.

**Goroutines (`go func() { ... }()`):** Inside a loop, we start up four worker bees, each doing its own thing at the same time. They're like little helpers ready to jump on any task that comes their way.

Use cases of the constructs:
-------------------------------

**Buffered Channel:** These channels are handy when you've got things happening at different speeds. They're great for situations like when you're sending messages back and forth between different parts of a program, and you don't want them to slow each other down.

**Goroutines:** These are like having a bunch of folks working on different tasks simultaneously. They're perfect for situations where you need to do multiple things at once, like handling lots of requests coming into a website.

Significance of the for loop with 4 iterations:
------------------------------------------------

The loop sets up four of our worker bees, each ready to grab tasks from the channel and get 'em done. similar to having a team of four friends helping out with different chores, to get everything done faster.

Significance of `make(chan func(), 10)`:
-----------------------------------------

This line sets up our task bucket, making sure it can hold up to 10 tasks at a time. It's like having a tray for dishes so you can keep piling them up without worrying about dropping any.

Why "HERE1" is not getting printed:
------------------------------------

The main part of the program sends a task to the bucket, hoping one of our worker bees will pick it up and get it done. But before any of them get a chance, the program goes ahead and says "Hello" and ends. 

The fix to the code snippet is present in solution.go with comments.
